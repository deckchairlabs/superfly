<hr />

_Inspired by [Remix](https://remix.run/) and the wonderful plugin [vite-plugin-ssr](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr)_

Superfly is an opinionated React framework similar to Next.js, but which uses modern frameworks, practices and tooling!

## Getting Started

```sh
npm install @deckchairlabs/superfly

# or

yarn add @deckchairlabs/superfly
```

Add the following to your projects `package.json`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "superfly dev",
    "build": "superfly build",
    "start": "superfly start"
  }
}
```
